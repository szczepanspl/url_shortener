# URL shortener
### This is a  simple Python application that allows users to enter a long URL and receive a shortened version in return. The shortened URL can then be shared with others, and when clicked, will redirect to the original long URL.

This project utilizes the Python programming language and the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface (GUI). I also make use of the pyshorteners library to handle the actual URL shortening process.
To get started with this project, you will need to have Python, the Tkinter and pyshorteners libraries installed on your machine.
Once you have everything set up, you can start the application by running the main.py file. This will open the GUI, which allows you to enter a long URL and receive a shortened version in return. The shortened URL will be displayed in the GUI and can be copied and shared with others.
Thank you for trying out the URL Shortener project. I hope you find it useful!
